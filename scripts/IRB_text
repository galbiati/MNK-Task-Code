<b>Purpose</b><br><p>The purpose of this study is to learn more about how humans reason in situations that require thinking several steps ahead. Thinking ahead is important in daily life, such as in planning a trip, playing soccer, or conducting negotiations. Nevertheless, it is not well understood how people make decisions in such situations. We are conducting this study to better understand how people learn to think ahead, why thinking ahead sometimes fails, and how it can be improved. The results of this study will allow us to formulate new theories about how the human mind works.</p><br><b>Procedure</b><br><p>You will be asked to play a board game on the computer, either against the computer or against another player. The rules of the game are simple and will be explained to you before you start playing. The board will appear on the computer screen. It may be empty or it may start with a puzzle position. Your job is to make moves by clicking with the mouse on squares of the board. After that, the computer will respond, and it will be your turn again. We will record your mouse movements, and in some cases your eye movements using an eye tracker. If we record your eye movements, we will ask you to keep your head relatively still; support for head and chin will then be provided. After the puzzle or game concludes, a new one will start. Each part of the experiment will last between 5 and 20 minutes. You can take breaks between the parts of the experiment. The total experimental session will last no more than one hour. The experiment may consist of up to four experimental sessions to be completed on different days, depending of how many data need to be collected. The experimenter will inform you of this before you give your consent.</p><br><b>Confidentiality</b><br><p>Your name and address will be collected for payment purposes, but this information will be kept confidential and only members of the research team will have access to it. Research data will not be linked to your identity. The results of this study may be published, but you will not be identified in these publications. There is a small risk for the loss of confidentiality, for example due to computer hackers. However, study personnel will make every effort to minimize this risk.</p><br><b>Risks and benefits</b></br><p>There is no risk from participation beyond that of everyday life. You may experience some fatigue, discomfort around the eyes, or, in rare cases, headeache. You can terminate participation at any time if any discomfort or pain occurs; if that happens, you will still be paid. If you are an employee, your employment status and evaluation will be in no way affected by your decision to participate or not participate in this study. If you are a student, your decision to participate or not participate will in no way affect your grades or academic standing. You will receive no direct benefits from your participation.</p></br><b>Payment</b><br><p>You will be paid $10 per one-hour session. If the study consists of multiple sessions, you may be paid a completion bonus after the last session.</p><br><b>Voluntary participation</b><br><p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time. If you withdraw, you will still receive full payment for that session. Do not sign this consent form unless you have had a chance to ask questions and have gotten satisfactory answers. If you agree to participate in this study, you will receive, upon request, a signed and dated copy of this consent form for your records.
