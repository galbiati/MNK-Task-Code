<p>Welcome to the experiment!
<br>You will first see three pages of instructions, then be given a consent form to accept.
<br>In the experiment, you will be playing and answering questions about an experimental game called Monk. Monk takes place on a 4 x 9 board, where players take turns placing pieces. A player wins when they have placed four pieces in a row in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
<br>In the first set of trials, you will be asked to play several games against a computer opponent. Please do your best to win!</p>
