<p style="font-size:120%">Today, you will be shown 200 short videos, either from games between two human players or between two computers. Half of the videos are from games between humans, the other half between computers. The videos may start from any point in a game, so the starting position is not necessarily an empty board.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%"> Your task is to identify if the video is from a <b>human-vs-human</b> game or a <b>computer-vs-computer</b> game. You will also be asked to report <b>how confident you are</b> about your choice. There is no time limit to this task. </p>
