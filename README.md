# MNK-Task-Code
This is a behavioral experiment suite that runs in a web browser (currently only compatibility checked with Chrome). The experiment involves an (M, N, K) game, with a MxN board on which players compete to get K in a row.

## How to Use
There are now several tasks functioning: playing against a computer, a turing test, and a demo task.

## Further
I will be further cleaning up the UI, subject registration/login, and data handling. I will also be reimplementing previous tasks in the new framework.
