# MNK-Task-Code
This is a behavioral experiment suite that runs in a web browser (currently only compatibility checked with Chrome). The experiment involves an (M, N, K) game, with a MxN board on which players compete to get K in a row.

## How to Use
I am currently transitioning from an AMP backend to Python/Tornado and MongoDB. This branch is very very WIP at the moment.

## Further
Currently, our aims are to run our original AI experiment and a "Turing test" experiment using the new system. It will be some time yet before we put the experiment fully online to collect data.

Priorities are UI and behavior for the Turing task, and implementing server to save data.
