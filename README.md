# MNK-Task-Code

This is a behavioral experiment that runs in a web browser (currently only compatible with Chrome). The experiment involves an "M,N,K" game, with a MxN board on which players compete to get K in a row. Tic-tac-toe and Gomoku are quintessential M,N,K games.

## How to Use
Currently, the only way to run this experiment is to download the directory and host with a Apache-MySQL-PHP server.

The server must have a data base configured appropriately; instructions on this will be added at some point, but currently you should be able to figure this out by looking at the PHP scripts.

## Future Plans
In the future, there should be two branches to this: the AMP branch, and a branch using PsiTurk to deploy the experiment on Mechanical Turk.

A branch using NodeJS may be added or replace the Apache branch at some point.

New tasks related to the game will be added periodically as they are developed.
